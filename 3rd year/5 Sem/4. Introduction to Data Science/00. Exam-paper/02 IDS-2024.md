                                Part-C

1. Suppose we want to investigate whether students will pass or fail in a subject based on the information like they studied, cheated, and slept well before the exam. You are given the following data for five students. There are three features, "Studied," "Slept," and "Cheated." The column "Result" shows the label we want to predict.

| Student    | Studied | Slept | Cheated | Result |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| Student 1  | Yes     | No    | No      | Passed |
| Student 2  | Yes     | No    | Yes     | Failed |
| Student 3  | No      | Yes   | No      | Failed |
| Student 4  | Yes     | Yes   | Yes     | Failed |
| Student 5  | Yes     | Yes   | No      | Passed |


(a) What is the entropy H (Result) at the root node of the following given data with the decision tree?
(b) Draw the decision tree where every split maximizes the information gain.

2. Let us assume two points, as (x1, yl) and (x2, y2) in the two-dimensional coordinate plane if we want to compute the distance between two points P(0, 4) and Q(6, 2) using Euclidean distance, then find the distance between P and Q.

3. Consider the following data given in the following table. Compute range in terms of central tendency.

| S. No. | Country    | Population |
|--------|------------|------------|
| 1      | Switzerland| 6,32,4014  |
| 2      | Italy      | 7,32,1211  |
| 3      | Canada     | 12,23,1221 |
| 4      | USA        | 9,21,6409  |
| 5      | Macedonia  | 5,21,4021  |
