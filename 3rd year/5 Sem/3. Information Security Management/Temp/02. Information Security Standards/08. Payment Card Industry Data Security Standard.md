The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a comprehensive set of security standards designed to ensure that all organizations that handle credit card information maintain a secure environment. It was established to protect cardholder data and reduce the risk of fraud and data breaches. 

PCI DSS consists of 12 requirements organized into six categories, which include building and maintaining a secure network, protecting cardholder data, maintaining a vulnerability management program, implementing strong access control measures, regularly monitoring and testing networks, and maintaining an information security policy. Compliance with these standards is essential for any business that processes, stores, or transmits credit card information, as it helps safeguard sensitive data and fosters trust with customers. 

The latest version, PCI DSS 4.0, introduces updates to address evolving security threats and technology changes, emphasizing a risk-based approach to security. Organizations must regularly assess their compliance status and implement necessary measures to meet the standards, which can involve technical controls, policies, and employee training. Failure to comply can result in significant penalties, including fines and increased liability for data breaches. **Overview of PCI DSS**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a critical framework aimed at enhancing the security of payment card transactions and protecting cardholder data. It was developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which includes major credit card brands.
