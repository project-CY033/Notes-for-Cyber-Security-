The CIS (Center for Internet Security) Critical Security Controls are a set of best practices designed to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture. These controls provide a prioritized and actionable framework for organizations to defend against the most common and impactful cyber threats. As of my last update in October 2023, the CIS Controls have evolved, and the latest version is CIS Controls v8, which emphasizes a more streamlined approach to security.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the CIS Critical Security Controls:

### 1. **Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets**
   - Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware assets within the organization to ensure only authorized devices are given access.

### 2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets**
   - Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software being used to ensure only authorized software is installed and can execute.

### 3. **Data Protection**
   - Protect organizational data through classification, handling, and encryption to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### 4. **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software**
   - Establish secure configurations for hardware and software to reduce vulnerabilities and improve security.

### 5. **Account Management**
   - Manage the lifecycle of user accounts, including creation, use, and deletion, to ensure only authorized users have access to systems.

### 6. **Access Control Management**
   - Implement processes to manage access to systems and data, ensuring that users have the least privilege necessary to perform their job functions.

### 7. **Continuous Vulnerability Management**
   - Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on information regarding vulnerabilities to reduce the window of exposure.

### 8. **Audit Log Management**
   - Collect, manage, and analyze audit logs to help detect and respond to incidents and ensure compliance.

### 9. **Email and Web Browser Protections**
   - Safeguard against threats delivered via email and web browsers by implementing security measures and user training.

### 10. **Malware Defenses**
   - Control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious code through the use of anti-malware tools and practices.

### 11. **Data Recovery**
   - Implement processes to ensure the availability of critical information by regularly backing up data and testing recovery procedures.

### 12. **Incident Response Management**
   - Establish and maintain an incident response capability to quickly detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

### 13. **Security Awareness and Skills Training**
   - Provide ongoing security awareness training to all employees to help them recognize and respond to security threats.

### 14. **Application Software Security**
   - Integrate security into the software development lifecycle to ensure that applications are developed securely.

### 15. **Incident Response and Management**
   - Develop and implement an incident response plan to effectively manage and respond to security incidents.

### 16. **Penetration Testing**
   - Regularly test the effectiveness of security controls through simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities and improve defenses.

### Implementation and Prioritization
The CIS Controls are designed to be implemented in a prioritized manner, focusing first on the most critical controls that can provide the greatest risk reduction. Organizations are encouraged to assess their current security posture, identify gaps, and implement the controls iteratively.
