### **Three Key Security Governance Components**  

Security governance consists of multiple components that work together to establish a secure, compliant, and resilient organization. The three core components of security governance are **Structure**, **Processes**, and **People**.  

---

## **1. Structure (Governance Framework & Policies)**  
This component defines the **organizational structure** for security governance, including roles, responsibilities, policies, and frameworks that guide security decision-making.  

### **Key Elements:**  
- **Security Policies & Standards:** Define security rules, acceptable behavior, and compliance requirements.  
- **Governance Frameworks:** Use industry-recognized frameworks such as **ISO 27001, NIST, COBIT, CIS Controls,** or **GDPR** for policy enforcement.  
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** Clearly define the duties of security leaders like the **CISO, IT security team, risk officers, and business executives.**  
- **Security Committees & Oversight:** Boards and committees oversee cybersecurity strategy and risk management.  

### **Outcome:**  
- A structured security governance model that aligns with business objectives.  
- Clear accountability and enforcement of security policies.  
- Compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices.

## **2. Processes (Risk Management & Compliance Controls)**  
Processes define **how security policies are implemented**, monitored, and maintained. These include risk management, compliance, incident response, and security monitoring.  

### **Key Elements:**  
- **Risk Management:** Identifies, assesses, and mitigates security risks. (E.g., vulnerability assessments, penetration testing).  
- **Compliance Management:** Ensures adherence to legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).  
- **Incident Response & Business Continuity:** Defines protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.  
- **Monitoring & Auditing:** Continuous security monitoring (SIEM tools) and internal/external audits ensure policy effectiveness.  
- **Change Management:** Controls how security changes are implemented without disrupting business operations.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Proactive identification and mitigation of security risks.  
- Regulatory compliance and reduced legal liabilities.  
- Efficient response to security incidents, minimizing business disruption.

## **3. People (Leadership & Security Culture)**  
Security governance is only effective if **people across the organization understand, support, and follow security practices.** Leadership, awareness, and training are crucial in building a security-first culture.  

### **Key Elements:**  
- **Executive Leadership:** The **Board, CISO, CIO, and senior management** drive security governance and ensure alignment with business goals.  
- **Security Awareness Training:** Employees are educated on threats like phishing, social engineering, and insider threats.  
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** IT teams, HR, legal, and compliance teams work together for effective security implementation.  
- **Security Champions:** Appointing security ambassadors within teams promotes a security-aware culture.  
- **Third-Party Risk Management:** Vendors and partners are also subject to security governance policies.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Employees actively participate in security best practices.  
- Reduced insider threats and human errors in security breaches.  
- Strong security culture across all levels of the organization.
