#  Security Governance and Security Management

 

Security governance and security management are critical components of an organization's overall cybersecurity strategy. Security governance refers to the framework and processes that ensure security initiatives align with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and risk management practices. It encompasses the policies, roles, and responsibilities that guide decision-making and accountability in security efforts.

On the other hand, security management involves the implementation and operationalization of security policies and procedures. This includes risk assessment, incident response, and the deployment of security technologies to protect information assets. Effective security management ensures that the governance framework is executed properly, enabling organizations to mitigate risks and respond to threats effectively.

Together, security governance and management create a comprehensive approach to safeguarding an organization's information and assets, ensuring that security measures are not only in place but also aligned with the organization's strategic goals. **Security Governance**
