## **1. Effectiveness of Security Policies & Controls**

**Objective:** Assess whether security policies, procedures, and controls are effectively protecting organizational assets.

### **Key Evaluation Methods:**

✔ **Security Audits & Assessments:** Evaluate existing security controls and their effectiveness.\
✔ **Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify weaknesses in networks, applications, and systems.\
✔ **Security Metrics & KPIs:** Measure incident response times, patch management success, and policy adherence.\
✔ **Employee Adherence:** Conduct security awareness tests (e.g., phishing simulations) to check user compliance.

### **Outcome:**

- Identification of security gaps and weaknesses.
- Improved enforcement of security controls.
- Stronger alignment of security measures with business objectives.

## **3. Risk Management & Threat Mitigation**

**Objective:** Assess how well the organization identifies, assesses, and mitigates security risks.

### **Key Evaluation Methods:**

✔ **Risk Assessments & Threat Modeling:** Identify potential attack vectors and their impact.\
✔ **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Measure how security risks affect business operations.\
✔ **Incident Response & Recovery Testing:** Evaluate how quickly and effectively the organization can respond to security breaches.\
✔ **Risk Register Review:** Ensure documented risks are managed and updated regularly.

## **4. Continuous Improvement & Security Maturity**

**Objective:** Ensure security governance evolves to address emerging threats and improve over time.

### **Key Evaluation Methods:**

✔ **Maturity Models (e.g., CMMI, NIST CSF):** Evaluate security maturity from initial (ad-hoc) to optimized (fully integrated).\
✔ **Lessons Learned from Incidents:** Review past breaches to improve security responses.\
✔ **Emerging Threat Intelligence Integration:** Update security measures based on the latest cyber threats.\
✔ **Security Culture Assessment:** Evaluate employee awareness, training effectiveness, and policy adoption.

### **Outcome:**

- Continual enhancement of security governance.
- Faster adaptation to new threats and compliance changes.
- A mature and well-integrated security governance framework.
