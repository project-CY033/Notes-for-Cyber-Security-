### 1. **Secure Coding**

**Definition:**  
Secure coding refers to the practice of writing software in a way that guards against the introduction of security vulnerabilities.

**Key Principles:**
- **Input validation:** Never trust user input.
- **Least privilege:** Code should execute with the least permissions necessary.
- **Error handling:** Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.
- **Authentication & access control:** Ensure users are properly authenticated and authorized.
- **Data protection:** Use strong encryption and secure data storage methods.

**Example:**
```python
# Insecure Code
username = input("Enter username:")
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"

# Secure Code (with parameterized query)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))
```

**Explanation:**  
The secure version prevents **SQL injection** attacks by using parameterized queries.

### 2. **Security Testing Methodology**

**Definition:**  
This refers to a structured approach to identify vulnerabilities in an application through testing techniques.

**Common Types:**
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyzing source code without executing it.
  - Tool example: SonarQube, Fortify
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Testing a running application.
  - Tool example: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):** Combines SAST and DAST; requires app to be running.
- **Penetration Testing:** Manual/automated testing to simulate real-world attacks.

**Steps in Methodology:**
1. **Planning:** Define scope, assets, and goals.
2. **Information Gathering:** Collect system info, user roles, data flow.
3. **Vulnerability Detection:** Use tools or code review.
4. **Exploitation:** Try to exploit weaknesses.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings, risk levels, and mitigation steps.

**Example:**  
If a web app does not sanitize input in a login field, a penetration test might attempt SQL injection (`' OR '1'='1`) to bypass login.

### 3. **Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

**Definition:**  
A Secure SDLC integrates security practices into each phase of traditional SDLC.

**Phases:**
1. **Requirements:** Identify security needs (e.g., compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS).
2. **Design:** Conduct threat modeling, define security controls.
3. **Development:** Apply secure coding practices, use security libraries.
4. **Testing:** Perform SAST, DAST, penetration tests.
5. **Deployment:** Ensure secure configuration, patch management.
6. **Maintenance:** Monitor logs, update software, manage incidents.

**Example:**  
During the design phase, if an application will store credit card information, PCI-DSS compliance is considered, and encryption of sensitive data is implemented.

### 4. **Application Security Overview**

**Definition:**  
Application security involves measures taken to prevent security flaws during and after development.

**Goals:**
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Protect sensitive data
- Ensure availability and integrity

**Common Threats:**
- **Injection Attacks (SQL, Command)**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Broken Authentication**
- **Insecure Deserialization**

**Security Controls:**
- **Authentication mechanisms:** OAuth, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Access control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Input validation:** Avoid XSS/SQL injection
- **Session management:** Use secure cookies, timeouts

**Example:**
A secure login system might:
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Use HTTPS for transmission
- Limit login attempts to prevent brute force
