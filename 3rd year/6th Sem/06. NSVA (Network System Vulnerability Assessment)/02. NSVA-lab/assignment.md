It turns out this ended up as a top result on Google for the stated error message. I uninstalled WinPCap (may not be necessary) and then installed Nmap version 7.01, which solved the issue for me without using the cygwin solution mentioned in the comments of the original question.

Update: I believe (for me) this may actually be a conflict with the winpcap version that Nessus uses. Both boxes that I've had this issue with have had both installed. So in addition to the above fix, make sure that the nessus service is shut down (if installed). I would also recommend (as others have stated) to grab the legit version of winpcap and NOT install it during the nmap install (just uncheck it in the installer).

tl;dr

Ensure the Nessus service isn't running (if installed)

Uninstall WinPCap

Install WinPCap from winpcap.org

Install Nmap 7.01 (uncheck winpcap in the installer)

```
