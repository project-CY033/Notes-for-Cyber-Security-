## **3. IoT Hardware and Software**

### **3.1 Sensors and Actuators**

Sensors and actuators are fundamental components of IoT systems, enabling devices to interact with the physical world by collecting data and performing actions based on that data.

#### **Humidity Sensors:**
Humidity sensors measure the amount of water vapor present in the air or other gases. They are crucial in applications such as weather monitoring, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, and industrial processes where moisture control is essential.

- **Types of Humidity Sensors:**
  - **Capacitive Humidity Sensors:** These sensors measure humidity by detecting changes in the capacitance of a thin strip of metal oxide caused by the absorption of moisture.
  - **Resistive Humidity Sensors:** These sensors measure humidity by detecting changes in the electrical resistance of a material due to humidity variations.
  - **Thermal Conductivity Humidity Sensors:** These sensors measure humidity by comparing the thermal conductivity of dry air with that of humid air.

#### **Ultrasonic Sensor:**
Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves at frequencies higher than the human audible range to detect objects and measure distances. They are widely used in applications such as proximity sensing, object detection, and level measurement.

- **Working Principle:**
  - The sensor emits ultrasonic waves that travel through the air and reflect off objects.
  - The sensor then receives the reflected waves and calculates the distance to the object based on the time taken for the waves to return.

#### **Temperature Sensor:**
Temperature sensors measure the temperature of their surroundings. They are essential in various applications, including environmental monitoring, industrial processes, and consumer electronics.

- **Types of Temperature Sensors:**
  - **Thermocouples:** These sensors generate a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between two junctions of dissimilar metals.
  - **Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs):** These sensors measure temperature by detecting changes in the electrical resistance of a metal wire.
  - **Thermistors:** These are temperature-dependent resistors that exhibit a large change in resistance with temperature.
  - **Infrared Sensors:** These sensors measure temperature by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by objects.
