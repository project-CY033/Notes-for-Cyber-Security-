## 1. Define and explain the three core principles of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
 
---

## **1. Confidentiality**
### 🔒 Definition:
Confidentiality refers to **protecting information from unauthorized access and disclosure**. The goal is to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems can view or access sensitive data.

### 📌 Explanation:
- Confidentiality is similar to **privacy**.
- It involves **preventing unauthorized users** (also called threat actors) from accessing data, whether the data is stored, in transit (moving across a network), or being processed.
- Techniques used to maintain confidentiality include:
  - **Encryption**: Scrambles data so only someone with the key can read it.
  - **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
  - **Access Control**: Limits who can access what (e.g., file permissions).
  - **Network Security Controls**: Like firewalls and VPNs that prevent eavesdropping.

### ✅ Example:
When you log into your bank account online, encryption (like HTTPS) ensures no one can see your account details or password while the data is being transmitted.

---

## **2. Integrity**
### 🧩 Definition:
Integrity ensures that **data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy** throughout its lifecycle. It protects information from being **altered**, either intentionally or accidentally, by unauthorized entities.

### 📌 Explanation:
- Integrity involves **detecting and preventing unauthorized changes** to data.
- Even a small unauthorized change can compromise the reliability of the system.
- Integrity is crucial in environments where data accuracy is critical (e.g., medical records, financial data).
- Mechanisms to enforce integrity include:
  - **Hash functions** (e.g., SHA-256): Generate a unique value for data to detect changes.
  - **Checksums and CRCs**: Used in networking to detect data corruption during transmission.
  - **Digital Signatures**: Verify the source and integrity of data.
  - **Audit Logs**: Record changes to data for accountability.

### ✅ Example:
If a hacker tries to change the recipient's bank account number in a money transfer, data integrity mechanisms can detect and block this modification.

---

## **3. Availability**
### 🌐 Definition:
Availability ensures that **authorized users have reliable and timely access** to information and systems when needed.

### 📌 Explanation:
- It’s not enough to protect data — users must be able to access it when required.
- Systems should be resilient and **recover quickly from disruptions** such as cyberattacks, power outages, or hardware failures.
- High availability is often achieved through:
  - **Redundancy** (e.g., backup servers, data replication).
  - **Failover systems**.
  - **Disaster Recovery Plans**.
  - **DDoS Protection** (Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks can block access).
  - **System Monitoring and Maintenance**.

### ✅ Example:
If an e-commerce website is down during a big sale, it loses revenue and customer trust. Ensuring availability helps prevent such losses.

## 2. Differentiate between online and offline password guessing attacks. What methods can be used to mitigate them?

Great question! Password guessing attacks are a common threat in **application and network security**, and they come in **two main types**: **online** and **offline** attacks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

## 🔍 2. **Difference Between Online and Offline Password Guessing Attacks**

### 🔐 **Online Password Guessing Attack**
**Definition:**
An **online attack** occurs when an attacker tries to guess a password by **interacting directly with the target system** (like a login page or authentication service).

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- The attacker sends login attempts **over the network** to the actual server.
- The system is **actively involved** in verifying each guess.
- Slower due to **network latency** and **rate limits**.
- Easier to **detect** and **block**.

### ✅ Example:
Trying to log into someone’s Gmail account by guessing their password through the actual Google login page.

### 🔰 Mitigation Methods:
1. **Account Lockout Policies** – Lock the account after a certain number of failed attempts.
2. **Rate Limiting** – Limit the number of login attempts per minute or per IP.
3. **CAPTCHAs** – Prevent automated login attempts.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Even if the password is guessed, the attacker can’t log in without the second factor.
5. **IP Blacklisting / Geofencing** – Block suspicious or repeated login attempts from unusual locations.

---

### 💾 **Offline Password Guessing Attack**
**Definition:**
An **offline attack** occurs when an attacker obtains a **copy of a password database or encrypted password file**, and then tries to crack the passwords **without interacting with the system**.

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- Much **faster** than online attacks, because there are **no system restrictions**.
- Often uses powerful tools and techniques like **dictionary attacks**, **brute force**, and **rainbow tables**.
- Common after a **data breach** where hashed passwords are stolen.

### ✅ Example:
An attacker steals a database of hashed passwords from a compromised server and tries to crack them on their own computer using tools like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper**.

### 🔰 Mitigation Methods:
1. **Strong Hashing Algorithms** – Use secure algorithms like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2** (instead of weak ones like MD5 or SHA1).
2. **Salting** – Add random data to each password before hashing to make precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables) ineffective.
3. **Peppering** – Add a secret value (kept on the server, not in the database) to further randomize the hash.
4. **Limit Access to Password Files** – Apply strict access control to prevent theft of password databases.
5. **Use MFA** – If passwords are cracked, the second factor can still block unauthorized access.

## 3. KDC’s Certification Revocation

## 🔐 3. **KDC’s Certification Revocation**

### 💡 First, what is a **KDC (Key Distribution Center)?**
A **Key Distribution Center** is a central authority in symmetric key cryptography systems, particularly used in **Kerberos authentication protocols**. Its main job is to:
- Issue **session keys** to users and services
- Authenticate entities in a secure way

The KDC typically has two main parts:
1. **Authentication Server (AS)** – Verifies the user's identity and provides a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT).
2. **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)** – Issues tickets for accessing specific services after TGT verification.

---

## 🚫 What is **Certification Revocation**?

In security systems, **revocation** refers to **invalidating a previously issued certificate or key** before its expiration date. This is necessary if a key or certificate:
- Gets compromised
- Is no longer needed
- Is associated with a user who has left the organization

For **KDCs**, revocation typically refers to **revoking keys or tickets** issued to clients or services.

---

## 🔄 **KDC’s Certification (or Ticket) Revocation in Kerberos**

### ✅ Reasons for Revocation:
1. **Compromised Credentials**: If a user's password or private key is stolen.
2. **User Account Termination**: The user is no longer authorized to access the network.
3. **Service Changes**: A service is no longer active or its keys have been compromised.
4. **Security Policy Violations**: If a user or service violates policy, access may be revoked.

---

### 🔧 **How Revocation Works in a KDC Environment:**

In Kerberos, traditional **certificate revocation** (like in PKI with CRLs or OCSP) doesn’t apply directly, because Kerberos uses **tickets with expiration times**.

Instead, Kerberos uses **short-lived tickets** and other mechanisms to handle revocation:

### 🧩 Mechanisms:
1. **Short Ticket Lifetimes**:
   - Tickets (TGTs and service tickets) have short expiration times (e.g., 8–10 hours).
   - This limits the damage from compromised tickets.
  
2. **Manually Removing Access**:
   - An admin can **disable or delete the user/service account** in the KDC database.
   - This blocks future ticket requests from that principal.

3. **Session Key Rotation**:
   - Periodic rotation of session keys can reduce the risk of long-term misuse.

4. **Ticket Blacklists (less common)**:
   - Some custom implementations may track known bad tickets and reject them.
   - Not native to Kerberos but can be implemented for added security.

5. **Credential Cache Deletion**:
   - On the client side, destroying the credential cache (e.g., using `kdestroy` in Unix) invalidates the ticket locally.
