## 1. Define and explain the three core principles of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.     [🔼 Back to Main Menu](#-asnf-questions-main-menu)

 
---

## **1. Confidentiality**
### 🔒 Definition:
Confidentiality refers to **protecting information from unauthorized access and disclosure**. The goal is to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems can view or access sensitive data.

### 📌 Explanation:
- Confidentiality is similar to **privacy**.
- It involves **preventing unauthorized users** (also called threat actors) from accessing data, whether the data is stored, in transit (moving across a network), or being processed.
- Techniques used to maintain confidentiality include:
  - **Encryption**: Scrambles data so only someone with the key can read it.
  - **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
  - **Access Control**: Limits who can access what (e.g., file permissions).
  - **Network Security Controls**: Like firewalls and VPNs that prevent eavesdropping.

### ✅ Example:
When you log into your bank account online, encryption (like HTTPS) ensures no one can see your account details or password while the data is being transmitted.

---

## **2. Integrity**
### 🧩 Definition:
Integrity ensures that **data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy** throughout its lifecycle. It protects information from being **altered**, either intentionally or accidentally, by unauthorized entities.

### 📌 Explanation:
- Integrity involves **detecting and preventing unauthorized changes** to data.
- Even a small unauthorized change can compromise the reliability of the system.
- Integrity is crucial in environments where data accuracy is critical (e.g., medical records, financial data).
- Mechanisms to enforce integrity include:
  - **Hash functions** (e.g., SHA-256): Generate a unique value for data to detect changes.
  - **Checksums and CRCs**: Used in networking to detect data corruption during transmission.
  - **Digital Signatures**: Verify the source and integrity of data.
  - **Audit Logs**: Record changes to data for accountability.

### ✅ Example:
If a hacker tries to change the recipient's bank account number in a money transfer, data integrity mechanisms can detect and block this modification.

---

## **3. Availability**
### 🌐 Definition:
Availability ensures that **authorized users have reliable and timely access** to information and systems when needed.

### 📌 Explanation:
- It’s not enough to protect data — users must be able to access it when required.
- Systems should be resilient and **recover quickly from disruptions** such as cyberattacks, power outages, or hardware failures.
- High availability is often achieved through:
  - **Redundancy** (e.g., backup servers, data replication).
  - **Failover systems**.
  - **Disaster Recovery Plans**.
  - **DDoS Protection** (Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks can block access).
  - **System Monitoring and Maintenance**.

### ✅ Example:
If an e-commerce website is down during a big sale, it loses revenue and customer trust. Ensuring availability helps prevent such losses.

## 2. Differentiate between online and offline password guessing attacks. What methods can be used to mitigate them?   [🔼 Back to Main Menu](#-asnf-questions-main-menu)


 

---

## 🔍 2. **Difference Between Online and Offline Password Guessing Attacks**

### 🔐 **Online Password Guessing Attack**
**Definition:**
An **online attack** occurs when an attacker tries to guess a password by **interacting directly with the target system** (like a login page or authentication service).

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- The attacker sends login attempts **over the network** to the actual server.
- The system is **actively involved** in verifying each guess.
- Slower due to **network latency** and **rate limits**.
- Easier to **detect** and **block**.

### ✅ Example:
Trying to log into someone’s Gmail account by guessing their password through the actual Google login page.

### 🔰 Mitigation Methods:
1. **Account Lockout Policies** – Lock the account after a certain number of failed attempts.
2. **Rate Limiting** – Limit the number of login attempts per minute or per IP.
3. **CAPTCHAs** – Prevent automated login attempts.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Even if the password is guessed, the attacker can’t log in without the second factor.
5. **IP Blacklisting / Geofencing** – Block suspicious or repeated login attempts from unusual locations.

---

### 💾 **Offline Password Guessing Attack**
**Definition:**
An **offline attack** occurs when an attacker obtains a **copy of a password database or encrypted password file**, and then tries to crack the passwords **without interacting with the system**.

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- Much **faster** than online attacks, because there are **no system restrictions**.
- Often uses powerful tools and techniques like **dictionary attacks**, **brute force**, and **rainbow tables**.
- Common after a **data breach** where hashed passwords are stolen.

### ✅ Example:
An attacker steals a database of hashed passwords from a compromised server and tries to crack them on their own computer using tools like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper**.

### 🔰 Mitigation Methods:
1. **Strong Hashing Algorithms** – Use secure algorithms like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2** (instead of weak ones like MD5 or SHA1).
2. **Salting** – Add random data to each password before hashing to make precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables) ineffective.
3. **Peppering** – Add a secret value (kept on the server, not in the database) to further randomize the hash.
4. **Limit Access to Password Files** – Apply strict access control to prevent theft of password databases.
5. **Use MFA** – If passwords are cracked, the second factor can still block unauthorized access.

## 3. KDC’s Certification Revocation   [🔼 Back to Main Menu](#-asnf-questions-main-menu)


 
---

## 🔐 3. **KDC’s Certification Revocation**

### 💡 First, what is a **KDC (Key Distribution Center)?**
A **Key Distribution Center** is a central authority in symmetric key cryptography systems, particularly used in **Kerberos authentication protocols**. Its main job is to:
- Issue **session keys** to users and services
- Authenticate entities in a secure way

The KDC typically has two main parts:
1. **Authentication Server (AS)** – Verifies the user's identity and provides a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT).
2. **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)** – Issues tickets for accessing specific services after TGT verification.

---

## 🚫 What is **Certification Revocation**?

In security systems, **revocation** refers to **invalidating a previously issued certificate or key** before its expiration date. This is necessary if a key or certificate:
- Gets compromised
- Is no longer needed
- Is associated with a user who has left the organization

For **KDCs**, revocation typically refers to **revoking keys or tickets** issued to clients or services.

---

## 🔄 **KDC’s Certification (or Ticket) Revocation in Kerberos**

### ✅ Reasons for Revocation:
1. **Compromised Credentials**: If a user's password or private key is stolen.
2. **User Account Termination**: The user is no longer authorized to access the network.
3. **Service Changes**: A service is no longer active or its keys have been compromised.
4. **Security Policy Violations**: If a user or service violates policy, access may be revoked.

---

### 🔧 **How Revocation Works in a KDC Environment:**

In Kerberos, traditional **certificate revocation** (like in PKI with CRLs or OCSP) doesn’t apply directly, because Kerberos uses **tickets with expiration times**.

Instead, Kerberos uses **short-lived tickets** and other mechanisms to handle revocation:

### 🧩 Mechanisms:
1. **Short Ticket Lifetimes**:
   - Tickets (TGTs and service tickets) have short expiration times (e.g., 8–10 hours).
   - This limits the damage from compromised tickets.
  
2. **Manually Removing Access**:
   - An admin can **disable or delete the user/service account** in the KDC database.
   - This blocks future ticket requests from that principal.

3. **Session Key Rotation**:
   - Periodic rotation of session keys can reduce the risk of long-term misuse.

4. **Ticket Blacklists (less common)**:
   - Some custom implementations may track known bad tickets and reject them.
   - Not native to Kerberos but can be implemented for added security.

5. **Credential Cache Deletion**:
   - On the client side, destroying the credential cache (e.g., using `kdestroy` in Unix) invalidates the ticket locally.

## 5. Explain TCP three-way handshaking and describe how it can be targeted in a SYN flood attack.   [🔼 Back to Main Menu](#-asnf-questions-main-menu)


 
---

## 🧩 5. **TCP Three-Way Handshake + SYN Flood Attack**

 

### 📡 **Part 1: TCP Three-Way Handshake**

The **TCP three-way handshake** is a method used to **establish a reliable connection** between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. ### **SYN (Synchronize)** – *Client to Server*
   - The client sends a **SYN** packet to the server to request a connection.
   - This packet includes the **initial sequence number (ISN)**.

2. ### **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)** – *Server to Client*
   - The server responds with a **SYN-ACK** packet.
   - It acknowledges the client's SYN and sends its own SYN, with its own sequence number.

3. ### **ACK (Acknowledge)** – *Client to Server*
   - The client replies with an **ACK**, confirming it received the server's SYN-ACK.
   - The connection is now established, and data transmission can begin.

### ✅ Diagram:
```
Client                          Server
  | --- SYN (seq=x) -------->   |
  |                            |
  | <-- SYN-ACK (seq=y, ack=x+1) |
  |                            |
  | --- ACK (ack=y+1) -------> |
```

---

### 🚨 **Part 2: SYN Flood Attack**

Now that we understand the handshake, let’s see how attackers can exploit it.

### 🔥 **What is a SYN Flood Attack?**

A **SYN flood attack** is a type of **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack that targets the **TCP handshake** process.

### 🧨 How It Works:

1. The attacker sends **many SYN requests** to the server.
2. The server allocates resources and replies with SYN-ACKs, waiting for the final ACK from the client.
3. But the attacker **never sends the final ACK** (or uses fake IP addresses).
4. The server **waits indefinitely** for the ACK, keeping the connection in a **"half-open"** state.
5. If enough of these half-open connections build up, the server’s **resources are exhausted**, making it **unable to handle legitimate traffic**.

### ❗ Effects:
- Server becomes **slow or unresponsive**
- **Legitimate users can't connect**
- **Denial-of-Service** is achieved

---

### 🛡️ How to Mitigate SYN Flood Attacks:

1. **SYN Cookies**:
   - Server doesn’t allocate resources immediately.
   - It encodes the information in the SYN-ACK and verifies it only when ACK comes back.

2. **Firewall/IPS Rules**:
   - Detect and block traffic with abnormal SYN rates.
   - Use rate limiting or connection thresholds.

3. **Timeout and Recycling**:
   - Quickly time out or recycle half-open connections.

4. **Load Balancers**:
   - Distribute traffic and absorb attack volume.

5. **TCP Intercept (in Cisco devices)**:
   - Acts as a proxy to validate the handshake before forwarding to the real server.

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Three-Way Handshake** | Process to establish a TCP connection with SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK      |
| **SYN Flood Attack**   | Attacker overwhelms the server by not completing the handshake    |
| **Impact**             | Server runs out of resources, causing denial of service           |

---

### **Key Differences in Security Approach**  
1. **Granularity**  
   - **OSI**: Strict separation of layers allows **per-layer security** (e.g., MAC filtering at Data Link, IPsec at Network).  
   - **TCP/IP**: Combines functions (e.g., Presentation/Session into Application), leading to **security consolidation** (e.g., TLS handling encryption + session security).  

2. **Real-World Usage**  
   - **OSI**: Used for **theoretical frameworks** (e.g., ISO standards, compliance).  
   - **TCP/IP**: Drives **practical implementations** (e.g., HTTPS for web, IPsec for VPNs).  

3. **Security Focus**  
   - **OSI**: Encourages **defense-in-depth** (e.g., encrypting data at multiple layers).  
   - **TCP/IP**: Relies on **end-to-end encryption** (e.g., TLS at Transport/Application).  

---

### **How Each Layer Contributes to Security**  
#### **OSI Layers**  
1. **Physical**: Protects against wiretapping, hardware tampering.  
2. **Data Link**: Secures local network access (e.g., Wi-Fi WPA3, VLAN segregation).  
3. **Network**: IPsec encrypts traffic between routers.  
4. **Transport**: TLS ensures secure data delivery (TCP) or DTLS (UDP).  
5. **Session**: Kerberos authenticates long-lived connections.  
6. **Presentation**: Encrypts data formats (e.g., S/MIME for emails).  
7. **Application**: Implements user-facing security (OAuth, HTTPS).  

---


### **Security Models: Comparison**

#### **OSI Security Model**
- **Layered Security**: Each layer implements its own security mechanisms.
  - **Physical**: Physical security (e.g., tamper-proofing).
  - **Data Link**: MAC filtering, VLAN segregation, IEEE 802.1X.
  - **Network**: IPsec, firewalls, VPNs.
  - **Transport**: TLS/SSL (though often mapped to Session layer).
  - **Session**: Session authentication, encryption.
  - **Presentation**: Data encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS).
  - **Application**: Application-level security (e.g., PGP, S/MIME).
- **Advantage**: Defense-in-depth approach, granular security controls.
- **Disadvantage**: Overly complex for real-world implementations.

#### **TCP/IP Security Model**
- **Simplified Security**:
  - **Network Interface**: Similar to OSI’s Physical/Data Link (MAC security, WPA3 for Wi-Fi).
  - **Internet (Network)**: IPsec, firewalls, VPNs.
  - **Transport**: TLS/SSL, DTLS (for UDP).
  - **Application**: HTTPS, SSH, DNSSEC, S/MIME.
- **Advantage**: More practical, aligns with real-world protocols (e.g., HTTPS over TLS).
- **Disadvantage**: Less granular security, relies heavily on Transport & Application layers.

### **How They Help in Designing Secure Networks**
| **Aspect**         | **OSI Contribution** | **TCP/IP Contribution** |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Defense-in-Depth** | Encourages security at every layer (e.g., MAC filtering + IPsec + TLS). | Focuses on critical layers (e.g., IPsec + TLS). |
| **Protocol Selection** | Helps choose layer-specific security (e.g., WPA3 for Wi-Fi, IPsec for routing). | Guides use of end-to-end encryption (TLS for web, SSH for remote access). |
| **Troubleshooting** | Easier to isolate security failures (e.g., if a switch is compromised, Data Link security is breached). | Simpler but may obscure layer-specific vulnerabilities. |
| **Compliance & Standards** | Used in formal security frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001). | Dominates real-world implementations (e.g., cloud security, IoT). |

---

### **Key Takeaways for Secure Network Design**
- **OSI Model** is better for **structured, theoretical security planning** (e.g., military networks, critical infrastructure).
- **TCP/IP Model** is more **practical for modern Internet-based systems** (e.g., cloud, web apps).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Many modern networks combine both:
  - Use **OSI’s layered security** for internal segmentation.
  - Apply **TCP/IP’s Transport/Application security** (TLS, OAuth) for external communications.

## 7. Pretty Good Privacy       [🔼 Back to Main Menu](#-asnf-questions-main-menu)


 
---

## 🔐 7. **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**

 

### 🧩 **What is PGP?**

**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)** is an **encryption program** that provides **cryptographic privacy and authentication** for:
- **Email communication**
- **Files and documents**
- **Data storage**

It was developed by **Phil Zimmermann** in 1991 and is still widely used (or its open-source version, **GPG**) for **secure communications**.

---

## 🔑 **Core Functions of PGP**

1. **Confidentiality** – Keeps the content private through **encryption**.
2. **Authentication** – Verifies the identity of the sender through **digital signatures**.
3. **Integrity** – Ensures the message has not been tampered with.
4. **Non-repudiation** – Sender cannot deny sending the message if it’s signed.

---

### ⚙️ **How Does PGP Work?**

PGP uses a combination of:
- **Symmetric-key cryptography** (fast encryption)
- **Public-key cryptography** (key exchange and authentication)
- **Hashing** (for digital signatures and integrity)

---

### 🔄 **PGP Process Flow**

#### 📨 **Sending a Message:**
1. **Create a message**.
2. Generate a **random symmetric key** to encrypt the message.
3. Encrypt the message with the **symmetric key** (fast).
4. Encrypt the symmetric key with the **receiver's public key**.
5. Attach a **digital signature** using the sender’s private key (optional).
6. Send the encrypted message + encrypted key + signature.

#### 📬 **Receiving a Message:**
1. Receiver **decrypts the symmetric key** using their **private key**.
2. Decrypts the message using the symmetric key.
3. **Verifies the digital signature** using the sender's public key.

---

### 🔐 Example Scenario:

Imagine Alice wants to send Bob a secure email.

- Alice uses Bob’s **public key** to encrypt a message.
- Only Bob can decrypt it using his **private key**.
- Alice signs it with her **private key**.
- Bob verifies her signature using Alice’s **public key**.

|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symmetric Encryption** | Used for encrypting actual message data (e.g., AES)                      |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Used for encrypting the symmetric key (e.g., RSA)                        |
| **Digital Signature** | Ensures authenticity and integrity (via hashing and private key signing)|
| **Key Pair**          | Each user has a **public key** (shared) and a **private key** (kept secret) |

## ✅ **Benefits of PGP**

- Strong encryption for confidentiality
- Authentication through digital signatures
- Doesn't rely on centralized authority (uses a **web of trust**)
- Still widely used via **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)**

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations of PGP**

- Complex for non-technical users
- Key management can be challenging
- Web of trust is hard to scale in large systems
- Not suitable for real-time communication (like VoIP)

## 🔐 8. What is **Kerberos**?

### ✅ **Definition:**
**Kerberos** is a **network authentication protocol** designed to provide **strong authentication** for client-server applications using **secret-key cryptography**.

- Developed at MIT.
- Uses **tickets** to allow nodes to prove their identity securely.
- Commonly used in **Windows Active Directory**, UNIX/Linux, and other secure environments.

---

## 🧩 **Kerberos Authentication Mechanism**

Kerberos uses a **trusted third-party** called the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**. The KDC has two components:

1. **Authentication Server (AS)**  
2. **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)**

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Authentication Process:

#### **1. Login Request (AS Exchange):**
- The **client** sends a request to the **Authentication Server** (AS) with its **User ID**.
- The AS checks if the user exists and replies with:
  - A **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)** (encrypted with the TGS's secret key)
  - A **session key** (encrypted with the user's password hash)

#### **2. User Authentication:**
- The client decrypts the session key using their password.
- If successful, this proves the client knows their password.

#### **3. Service Ticket Request (TGS Exchange):**
- The client sends the TGT to the **TGS**, along with a request to access a specific service.
- It also includes an **authenticator** (timestamped and encrypted with the session key).
- The TGS verifies the TGT and authenticator, then issues a **service ticket** for the target service.

#### **4. Accessing the Service (Client/Server Exchange):**
- The client sends the **service ticket** and another **authenticator** to the service.
- The service validates both and grants access if they match and timestamps are valid.

## 🛡️ **How Kerberos Protects Against Replay Attacks**

A **replay attack** is when an attacker intercepts valid credentials and reuses them later to gain unauthorized access.

### 🔐 Kerberos Defense Mechanisms:

| Feature              | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timestamps**        | Each authenticator has a **timestamp** (e.g., valid for 5 minutes).         |
| **Nonces**            | Random values used in encrypted exchanges to ensure uniqueness.            |
| **Short-lived Tickets** | Tickets and authenticators expire quickly, making them useless if replayed. |
| **Mutual Authentication** | The server also authenticates itself to the client, preventing impersonation. |

🧠 **So even if an attacker captures a TGT or service ticket, it’s useless after expiration.**

```
Client        AS        TGS        Server
  | --- AS-REQ (ID) --> |
  | <-- TGT + Session --|
  | --- TGT + Auth ---->|
  | <-- Service Ticket -|
  | --- Service Ticket -->|
  | <-- Access Granted --|
